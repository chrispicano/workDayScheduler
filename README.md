# workDayScheduler
On this applicated I put together a daily work scheduler for a busy employer by using jQuery. Displayed on the home page you'll find the current date and the hours for a generic work schedule. Each text back is labeled by time and the user is able to input data for the specific hour. By utulizing localStorage I was also able to make it possible for the user to save their data.
